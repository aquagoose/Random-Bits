# Number Rush!
Number Rush is my first C++ game. It's a simple "press the buttons in the right order" game.. A rhythm game, I suppose. Although, you don't loose points for pressing the wrong number.

### How to play
It's simple! Numbers come in from the right, and you have to press the number before it reaches the left side of the playing field. If that happens, you lose.
But, you have to remember to press the numbers in the right order!
The higher your points, the faster it will go. **The speed is uncapped.**

### Problems with my code?
Let me know! I'm only trying to get better. Any feedback, positive or negative, is appreciated, just make sure it's constructive please! "It's s***" doesn't get anyone anywhere.

### Acknowledgements
The drawing code has been heavily modified, however originates from the [OLC Tetris Project](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/OneLoneCoder_Tetris.cpp). I recommend checking it out!

Thank you for checking out Number Rush!
